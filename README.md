### 🪪 Who I Am

I'm not just a Java developer.  
I'm the kind of engineer who reads logs like novels, enjoys debugging more than scrolling Facebook,  
and smiles every time I delete 100 lines of legacy code no longer needed.

I currently work in consumer finance, building systems that matter — where bugs are money and performance is trust.

---

### 🔧 What I Do Best

- Design systems that can grow without breaking
- Write backend services that are readable, testable, and observable
- Speak fluent `Java`, `Spring Boot`, `Kafka`, `Redis`, `MySQL`, `Docker`, and `Kubernetes`
- Ship things. Refactor things. Automate things.

### 🎯 What Drives Me

I don't want to just *code* — I want to *build*.  
Build systems that scale. Build code that lasts.  
Build myself into an architect who makes complexity feel simple.

Cloud-native, event-driven, observable-by-default — that’s where I’m headed.

### 💡 How I Work

- 🧠 Think clearly  
- ✍️ Write precisely  
- 📦 Ship reliably  
- 🤐 Talk less, code more
