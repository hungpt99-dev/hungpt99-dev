### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a backend developer born in 1999, currently working in the consumer finance sector.  
I specialize in building scalable backend systems using Java and Spring Boot.  
Driven by curiosity and a passion for clean architecture, I enjoy exploring complex systems and breaking them down into simple, maintainable components.

### ✅ Strengths

- Strong understanding of system design, RESTful APIs, and data flow in distributed systems
- Experienced with:
  - `Java`, `Spring Boot`, `MySQL`
  - `Kafka`, `Redis`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes`
  - CI/CD using GitLab Pipelines
- Code quality mindset: I refactor often and hate leaving messy code behind

---

### 💡 My Personality at Work

- **Straightforward** – I speak with clarity and code with purpose
- **Detail-oriented** – Backend code must be precise, reliable, and tested
- **Quiet but solid** – I don’t talk much, but I always deliver

---

### 🎯 What I'm Aiming For

- Become a **backend architect**: deep understanding, strong system design, and hands-on coding ability
- Master cloud-native technologies: GCP, Kubernetes, event-driven architectures
- Build backend systems that are **reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain**

### 💬 My Coding Philosophy
